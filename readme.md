# brshSysInfo - Powershell System Information module

All the system information that's fit to print (although some only work with Admin rights - cuz... reasons). Powershell for Windows and PSCore compatible.

The big bright shiny function from this module is the SystemReport - via `get-siSystemReport`, but the info is available in bite sized (mostly) psobject'ed morsels in the following functions:

| Command                    | Description                                                    | SystemReport |

| Get-siLogon                | Current User, Domain, and LogonServer                          |              |
| Get-siSysInfoHelp          | List commands available in the brshSysInfo Module              |              |

| Get-siUptime               | Timespan that the computer has been running                    |              |
| Set-siSystemReportSettings | Change the Settings for the System Report                      |              |
| Get-siOSInfo               | Pulls Operating System info from all over the place            | True         |
| Get-siDriveInfo            | Pulls Drive info from WMI                                      | True         |

| Get-siSystemUserEventInfo  | Pulls logon and reboot info from the EventLog                  | True         |

Not everything shows up in the System Report - that's because, for example, on some systems the Windows Update script can run very slow, or, for another example, the info is supplementary, nice sure, but not really needed in the report. You can toggle the on/off of most of the report items with the `Set-siSystemReportSettings` function.

You can also control the order of the information chunks. Use the `Get-siSystemReportSettings` to see the existing order.

I still need to adjust formatting for the any new items (Get-siSystemUserEventInfo I think is the only one), so that won't yet show up in the System Report.

#### BGInfo
If you've looked at my BGInfo repo, you'll notice some similarities ... cuz these were ripped completely from there. As such, this _should_ work out-of-the-box with BGInfo. I haven't spent much time testing that yet, and there's no vbs wrapper written yet. But soon!

#### Coming
* Save System Report Settings
* Tested BGInfo config with working VBS
* More formatting!
* More information!
